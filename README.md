# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a text-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. Play multiple rounds against the computer, track your scores, and see who wins overall!

## How to Play
- **Run the Game**: Execute the script with `python rock_paper_scissors.py` in your terminal.
- **Enter Your Choice**: Type `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` to make your choice.
  - Input is case-insensitive, so `Rock`, `ROCK`, or `rock` all work.
- **View the Result**: The computer randomly chooses its option, and the game shows both choices and the outcome (e.g., "You win!", "You lose!", or "It's a tie!").
- **Track Scores**: After each round, see the current score (e.g., "Score - User: 1, Computer: 0"). A win adds 1 point; ties and losses add 0 points.
- **Play Multiple Rounds**: After each round, choose to continue by typing `yes` or quit with `quit` at the "Play again? (yes/quit): " prompt (case-insensitive).
- **Final Summary**: When you quit, see a final summary (e.g., "Final Score - User: 2, Computer: 1. You win the game!" or "It's a tie overall!" if scores are equal).
- **Requirements**: Python 3 is required. No additional dependencies needed.

## Example
If you choose `rock` and the computer chooses `scissors`, the output might be:
